Some tips and notes that may be useful when working with the included packages.

- [Importing and processing spectral and image data with `pavo`](http://pavo.colrverse.com/articles/pavo-2-importing_processing.html): A introduction to importing and process spectral data and images (from the vignette).

- [Batch importing spectral data and metadata with `lightr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/lightr/articles/batch_import.html): `pavo` uses `lightr` for basic spectral importing, but when more complex parsing is required, or you also want to extract spectral metadata, it's best to work directly with `lightr`. This is a brief introduction (from the vignette).

- [Analysing spectral and spatial (image) data with `pavo`](http://pavo.colrverse.com/articles/pavo-3-analysing.html): A detailed overview of the spectral and image-based analyses available in pavo (from the vignette).

- [Renormalising spectral data with a custom reference](https://docs.ropensci.org/lightr/articles/renormalise.html): In extreme cases, it may be necessary to use low-level parsers to manually normalise spectra, which `lightr` provides access to (from the vignette).

- [A comparison of spectral parsing with `lightr` and 'official' software](https://docs.ropensci.org/lightr/articles/true_example.html): A brief comparison of `lightr`'s parsers and their official counterparts (from the vignette).
